  a creative explorer with a love for graphic design, 3D art, programming, and a bit of photography on the side. I’ve been immersed in the digital world since I can remember, always finding new ways to blend creativity with technology. Whether it’s crafting a clean design or diving into code, I’m all about bringing ideas to life.

  I’ve always been curious, and that curiosity drives me to keep learning and trying new things. I get a kick out of discovering new tools or techniques — it’s like finding a hidden feature in a game. I’m quick to adapt and love staying on top of the latest trends, but I’m also practical and grounded in what really works.
