description: 
  en: A instant camera project for the current age, modelled in Blender. It has a color e-ink display hidden behind two wooden doors, and no solid state memory. It can only take (and display) a single picture at a time. When a new one is taken, the previous one is erased. It doubles as a picture frame. <br> I designed it as a reflection on permanence and commodification of photos.
