  en: I always wanted Apple to release a colorful MacBook Air, as a sort of homage to the original iBook. Well, recently I realized I was capable of making a plausible render of what it would look like. This was an exercise not only modeling (no ready made assets were used) but also understanding a product identity. The aestetic closely follows Apple's current iMac lineup.
